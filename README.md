# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

My aim for this project was to try achieve a high score in a kaggle competition by gathering insights from 
exploratory data analysis. I tried a few machine learning algorithms with a Lasso regression performing 
best in the end scoring in the top 2%. The jupyter notebook documents steps I took with this problem.
